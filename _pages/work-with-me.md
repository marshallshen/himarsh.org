## why this document
Every technical leader is different. This document is an effort to share my working style and set working expectations.

### note on the version number
Being a leader is a process and constant work-in-progress. And this document will evolve with new learnings and reflections.

## my role
My role is to help build resilient and collaborative engineering teams. Engineering teams have two primary goals: delivery and growth. By delivery, I mean shipping meaningful products with solid requirements within the expected timeframe. By growth, I mean that by delivering meaningful products, the people within the team get better and grow in their career.

## what do I value most?
* **growth mindset**. Everyone has the ability to learn and grow. Failure is not evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
* **make things simple**. It is easy to make things complicated. Making things simple means putting complex ideas into clear frameworks, and it takes mastery of structured thinking and intentional communication. 
* **feedback**. Timely and actionable feedback helps me grow and the team better. I like to ask questions when receiving feedback to understand the context, and take actions based on my understanding.
* **collaboration**. A group is smarter than an individual. When I encounter a problem that is complex to solve, I proactively reach out to specific people for help and be clear on what I need help on.
* **first principle**. When approaching any situation, seek to understand the root cause of the situation before taking action.

## my expectations
* **take ownership**. Doing something is different from owning something. Doing is about taking action, while owning is taking action AND being committed to and responsible for achieving the intended outcome.
* **optimization over perfection**. No product is perfect, what’s meaningful to us is making products better, and we become better along the way. Done is better than perfect.
* **be kind to each other**. Be mindful of others’ time and space, treat others how we want to be treated. For example, when scheduling a meeting or asking for help, be mindful of when people are not available. When the team is together for a team, stay present at the moment, give the best attention to each other, and the subject at hand.
* **celebrate and learn**. We celebrate our successes, and we learn from our mistakes. It’s through reflection and iteration that we deliver and grow. 

## 1:1s
* 1-1s are very important to me because they are dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want
* They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me
* It’s not a status meeting unless you want to talk about status
* 1-1s are flexible -- they can shift and change to fit around our shifting schedules
* Don’t save urgent matters for a 1-1!

## personality quirks
* I’m more comfortable in small groups than big ones.
* I care deeply about understanding first principles.
* I need time alone to reflect and process new facts before forming an opinion.
* According to Myers–Briggs Type Indicator, I’m classified as INTJ personality type. And I tend to do what others expect of me, as well as what I expect from myself.
* When facing situations or challenges that I am familiar with, I tend  to act quickly in an organized way (e.g. checklist). However, when facing unknown situations, I tend to take more time to process information and ask questions and come up with actions later on.
