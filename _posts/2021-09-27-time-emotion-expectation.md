For everyone, time is the one true limited resource.
For everyone, expectation leads to how we spend our time.
How we spend time is manifested through actions.
Our actions, together with our expectation, impact our emotion.

Time, expectation, and emotion are like the triangle of a framework for life.
To live a good life means to balance te triangle well.

Question for time: how do we want to live our life?
Question for expectation: what do we expect our life to be? 
Question for emotion: how do we feel about our current life?

These questions are grand and simple, complex and elegant. These questions are also timeless, and it grounds us everyday, and helps us focus on what's truly important.
