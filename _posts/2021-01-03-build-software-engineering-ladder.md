## Outline

- Engineering ladders = how do engineers grow + how are engineers compensated
- how do engineers grow
  * identify pillars
  * define levels
  * for each leve, define expectation of each pillar
  * show the progression of expectation for each pillar, each level
- how are engineers compensated
  * each level has a wild range, so that it can have same level with different salary
  * jumping from levels should guarantee at least 10% rise
  * releveling each year, tie releveling with performance review
  * performance review should tie to how people grow
